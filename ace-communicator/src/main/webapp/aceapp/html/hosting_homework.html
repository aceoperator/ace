there are two types of canned messages:
    <p>For a <b>text</b> message, you simply need the text of the
message. When an operator sends this type of canned message, the
message text will appear in the other user's conversation window as if
the operator had typed the message in.</p>
    <p> For a <b>URL</b> canned message, you need the URL
(ie, http://www.xyz.com). When an operator sends this type of canned
message, a separate browser window pops up on the other user's screen,
displaying the URL.<br>

</ul>
